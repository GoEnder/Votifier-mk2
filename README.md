Votifier-mk2
============
A Minecraft Plugin to replace Votifier, due to the very backwards implementation of RSA


What is Votifier-mk2
-----------------
Votifier-mk2 is a replacement for the "Votifer" plugin for Minecraft.  
Due to how Votifier implimented RSA, it has a lot of very large security holes that almost render it's security as none.  
  
  
  
How is it different?
-----------------
**In Votifier**  
the RSA Private and Public keys are generated by the Minecraft Server,  
_The Public key is then given to the server listing website_, like Planet Minecraft.  
There is a large flaw here, where if your Public key is leaked, anyone can spoof votes to your server.  
You must make a new set of keys, making you have to update all the websites with your new key.  
_**This is inherently wrong, and defeats the purpose of RSA**_
  
  
  
**In Votifier-mk2**  
The RSA Private and Public keys are generated by the website,  
_The Public key is given to the Minecraft Server._  
If you happen to put a bad public key in your Minecraft Server, you just remove it.  
You no longer have to regenerate your keys, or any keys, or update any websites.  
_**This is how RSA keys are meant to be used**_  
  
  

How does RSA work?
------------------
RSA works by generating two keys, The **Private** key, and the **Public** key.  
The **Private** key is mean to never, ever be shared. It is meant to be **Private**.  
The **Public** key is meant to be shared, givien out, and it is meant to be **Public**.  
**The Private key basically is the _end-all-be-all_ that says _"I am, who i say i am"_**  

The keys are used to "Scramble" messages,  
The private key scrambles it in a way that only the public key can read.  
If the private key sends out a message, anyone can read it.  
  
  
The public key scrambles it in a way that only the private key can read.  
If the public key sends out a message, only the private key can read it.  



How is this relevant? 
-------------------
In Votifier-mk2, all messages are sent from the website using the private key, anyone can read them.  
Nobody can pretend to be that website.  
_**This, is secure**_  

In Votifier, all messages are sent from the website using the public key, nobody but the server can read them.  
Anyone with the public key can send them to the server.  
_**This, is not secure**_
