Votifier-mk2
============
A Minecraft Plugin to replace Votifier, due to the very backwards implementation of RSA


What is Votifier-mk2
-----------
Votifier-mk2 is a replacement for the "Votifer" plugin for Minecraft.  
Due to how Votifier implimented RSA, it has a lot of very large security holes that almost render it's security as none.  



How is it different?
-----------
In Votifier, the RSA Private and Public keys are generated by the Minecraft Server, and then the Public key is given to the server listing website.  
There is a large flaw here, where if your Public key is leaked, anyone can spoof votes to your server.... And then you have to make a new set of keys, making you have to update all the websites with your new key.  
**This is inherently wrong, and defeats the purpose of RSA**

In Votifier-mk2, The RSA Private and Public keys are generated by the website, and the Public key is given to the Minecraft Server.
If you happen to put a bad public key in your Minecraft Server, you can just remove it for that one site, instead of having to regenerate a new key and update all the websites.
**This is how RSA keys are meant to be used**
