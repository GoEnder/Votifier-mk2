Votifier-mk2
============
A Minecraft Plugin to replace Votifier, due to the very backwards implementation of RSA


What is Votifier-mk2
-----------
Votifier-mk2 is a replacement for the "Votifer" plugin for Minecraft.  
Due to how Votifier implimented RSA, it has a lot of very large security holes that almost render it's security as none.  
  
  
  
How is it different?
-----------
In Votifier, the RSA Private and Public keys are generated by the Minecraft Server, and then the Public key is given to the server listing website.  
There is a large flaw here, where if your Public key is leaked, anyone can spoof votes to your server.... And then you have to make a new set of keys, making you have to update all the websites with your new key.  
**This is inherently wrong, and defeats the purpose of RSA**
  
In Votifier-mk2, The RSA Private and Public keys are generated by the website, and the Public key is given to the Minecraft Server.
If you happen to put a bad public key in your Minecraft Server, you can just remove it for that one site, instead of having to regenerate a new key and update all the websites.  
**This is how RSA keys are meant to be used**  
  
  

How does RSA work?
-----------
RSA works by generating two keys, The "Private" key, and the "Public" key.  
The "Private" key is mean to never, ever be shared.  
The "Public" key is meant to be shared, givien out, and made public.  
  
The private key basically is the end-all-be-all that says "I am, who i say i am"  

Theys keys are used to "Scramble" messages,  
The private key scrambles it in a way that only the public key can read, so if the private key sends out a message, anyone can read it.  
The public key scrambles it in a way that only the private key can read, so if the public key sends out a message, only the private key can read it.  



How is this relivant? 
-----------
In Votifier-mk2, all messages are sent from the website using the private key, anyone can read them, but nobody can pretend to be that website. **This, is secure**  
In Votifier, all messages are sent from the website using the public key, nobody but the server can read them, but anyone with the public key can send them to the server. **This, is not secure**
