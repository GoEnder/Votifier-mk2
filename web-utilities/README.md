Votifier-mk2 Website Utilities
==============
This is a set of utilities for Server List Websites to use for initial setup  

These are not provided as examples, or in more then one language for a reason  
These should **only** be run when you are setting up, or regenerating your keys  

These **require** that you edit the configuration in the files to properly make them work  
  


Side note: I realise that ListKey.py is horrendusly ugly code. I will clean it up asap.
