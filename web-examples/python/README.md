In this folder you'll find examples on how to create, sign, and send the vote  

The file that you need is `sendVote.py`  
This file is all you need to send a vote to a server.  
  
The file `verifyVote.py` is provided as a example of how Votifier-mk2 will read votes  
and can be used to check if your own signature program is working properly  
**It is not needed to send votes**
