Votifier-mk2 Central Repository
-------------
Votifier-mk2 will have a "Central Repository" that helps keep security to a maximum for everyone.  
Because of how the Repository works, it will require manually enabling before use.  
  

**For Server List Owners**
The Central Repository will keep your keys in a easily seen location  
It will also keep your keys up to date with Server Owners and greatly reduce vote spoofing even further  
This requires sending a request to us with your key every time you change it. This should not be often.  

Why you should use it:
 * Your keys are avaliable to anyone looking to add your website to their vote list  
 * Your keys are checked for integrity and if any comprimization has happened  
 * Free listing in our Repo for your site  
  

**For Minecraft Server Owners**
The Central Repository will allow you to reach out and access keys in a easy to find place
  
Why you should use it:
 * Keys can be automatically checked for comprimization every startup  
 * Keys can easily be added or removed on the fly with a command in-game  
 * Automatic updates for keys if they are out of date or comprimized  
 * Easy, or Automatic Generation of Config Files  
  
  
**What is Comprimization**  
Comprimization is when a Server List website's Private Key is comprimized (made public or abused)
